### Freshman Music Calligraphy Kit

This kit lives at the Switchboard. When you check it out, **take it to the Coffee Shop** and use it there. If you go to the Switchboard and the kit is checked out, head over to the Coffee Shop and share with whoever checked it out.

When you check this kit out, **you are responsible for returning it with all its parts intact**. That means that if some friends join you to use the kit together, you are responsible for making sure everything makes it back into the kit. If you have to leave before others have finished, designate someone else to be responsible. Because if parts go missing, how will we do music calligraphy!
