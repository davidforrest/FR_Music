### Three Note Naming Systems  
*A-B-C, 1-2-3, Do-Re-Mi, (baby you and me)*

This is only an outline at the moment, but I'll add more throughout the week, so check back!

- In Week 1, we started with our intuitions, built a musical system, and gave it **letter names**.
- Then last week and this week, we sang positions within that system, and reoriented to different anchors. 
  - Why do the different anchors create different feelings? Because there is an uneven spacing of the notes (letter positions) in our musical system (see the [monochord inlay](monochord_note_spacing.pdf) from class).
  - When we're not there to sing and say "put *this* note *here*," we can use a clef: "put a C or an F *here*." 
- And we can use **numbers** to start from any letter position.
  - the evenness of the numbers correspond to the evenness of the lines and spaces of the staff&mdash;we hear these as successive degrees, even though the spaces (ratios) between the notes of our musical system are uneven.
- But what if we wanted the sound (and the uneven spaces) of the C mode, but starting on F?
  - **Syllables** from the chant *Ut Queant Laxis* gave us a way to represent the uneven distances in the diatonic system, but abstracted from the letters.
    - Guido’s system only included six syllables: Ut through La. The syllable “Si” (named after the final phrase “Sancte Iohannes”) was added by later musicians to expand Guido’s syllables to the full seven note system. That system of seven notes, however, existed before Guido—they were the seven notes Euclid constructed on the monochord, with the letter names given later by Odo of Cluny (in our first week’s reading). So first we had our A, B, C, D, E, F, G system, and then Guido came up with syllables for six of those seven notes.
    - The reason for the syllable system was to help singers learn a new chant based on the sound of a chant that was already familiar to them. *Ut Queant Laxis* was not necessarily more inspiring than any other chant, but it would have been familiar, and it had the unique property that each of its phrases began on a successively higher note. So if you wanted to sing the “D” mode, you could remember the familiar tune of *Ut Queant Laxis*, sing up to the syllable “Re,” and that would give you the sound of a “D,” relative to the other notes in the diatonic system.
  - so we can make Ut (which would be the C mode), starting on F, as is done in Hodie. And then we need a new note&mdash;a "lower" version of the B.
  - Continuing in this way, we can populate a 12 note system, with "lower" and "higher" variations of the letters, changing different letters depending on which mode we want to create from which starting note.
- So, an accidental (like the &#9837; in Hodie) can set the staff to a particular mode or anchor. 
- But these symbols can also be departures from the existing mode or anchor.
  - Moving the accidental to the beginning of the line modifies every instance of that note throughout the piece, establishing a new context (a "key signature"). Then any remaining accidentals are departures from that context.
  - The modified staff matches what we hear, since we're listening in the context of the key signature.
  - And this raises the question: is a momentary departure from context a move into a different context? (TBC in *Ave Verum Corpus*)
