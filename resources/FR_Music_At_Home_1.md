Hi Freshman Music,

I hope you enjoyed our first class! Here’s a list, in order of importance, of what to do before we meet again next week. You’ll find everything below either in the Freshman Music Manual, or on our [resources](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/) page. 



**[1.]** Practice your tonescapes daily. Once you feel comfortable with the [first recording](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/tonescapes_1.mp3), move on to the [second recording](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/tonescapes_2.mp3).

- Listen at least once (~5min) but not more than 3 times (~15m) in one sitting.

- This is very much a self exploration, and your experience will be different from your classmates. Try to develop a greater sensitivity to what you hear, and to how you make sense of what you hear. Be creative about finding techniques that work for you.

- Please email me if you get stuck, or have any questions, or would like to share an experience you have, or a technique you discover. Anything you share will be helpful for us all!

  

**[2.]** Pick up a copy of the Freshman Music Manual from the Bookstore, and read Boethius: excerpts from *On Music* and *On Arithmetic* (pp. 49-54)

- Start from Section IV, "Concerning the Division of Mathemetics" (p. 49) and read through the end (p. 54). Section VIII tells the story of Pythagoras and the blacksmith, which is the origin myth of music theory.

  

**[3.]** Look over the following three selections linked on the resource page. 

- [Selected Props from Euclid Division of a Monochord](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/euclid_props/selected_props.html). This will give you an idea of how Euclid constructs the Ancient Greek musical system. Keep in mind, the letters Euclid uses for his constructions are not meant to correspond to the names of musical notes.

- [(pseudo) Odo of Cluny: Letters of the Monochord](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/odo_monochord.pdf). The same system constructed differently in the Middle Ages, with letter names assigned to the notes. 

- [Selection from *Measurement of Tones* by Annapolis tutor Peter Kalkavage](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/Kalkavage_measurement_selection.pdf). An excellent overview of this system.

  

**[4.]** Optional: Listen to the different recordings of the *Orestes Fragment* and the *First Delphic Paean*. Also look at the scores for these pieces in the Manual (pp. 19-20) and compare them with the Ancient Greek notation in the Score Supplements. Consider what’s involved in turning an Ancient Greek fragment into a modern musical performance—what does it mean to encounter an Ancient Greek musical text directly?

- If you’re interested in doing a deeper dive into Ancient Greek notation, you can start by matching the symbols on the Orestes fragment with the symbols on the transcription (both in the [Score Supplement](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/orestes_supplement.pdf) , and comparing those symbols to the Ancient Greek alphabet. Then let me know if you’d like to dive even deeper.



Looking forward to our next class!

Mr. Forrest
