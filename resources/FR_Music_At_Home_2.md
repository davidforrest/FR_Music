Hi Freshman Music,

Here’s what to do before our next meeting. Remember, you can check out the [Music Calligraphy Kit](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/calligraphy_kit.html) from the Switchboard any time you like, and use it in the Coffee Shop. Bring your friends!



1. Practice your tonescapes daily for between 5 and 15 minutes. You can do the following in order, all in one sitting:

- If you haven’t already, jump in to the[ second recording](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/tonescapes_2.mp3) from last week.

- Then try [this week’s recording](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/tonescapes_3.mp3), where you imagine the note first before it’s played.

- - [Here’s](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/inside_a_tonescape.mp3) the simulation of what it sounds like to imagine notes inside a tonescape.

- Then turn on the [tonescape by itself](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/tonescapes_0.mp3), and try reading [these notes](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/reading_imagery_1.pdf) (the last page of your handout) silently to yourself. Then turn the page upside-down and read it again. 

  

2. Compose a Gregorian chant:

​	**To prepare:**

- Check out [these examples](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/gregorian_notation_examples.pdf) of Gregorian illuminated manuscripts.
- Look through the chants in the Manual on pp. 21-36, and listen to some of the chant recordings on our [resources page](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/#week-2). You can follow along with the Gregorian neume notation in the Manual as you listen. This is to get a feeling for the sound of Gregorian chant.
- Read the excerpt from Guido of Arezzo's *Micrologus*, Manual pp. 38-40, on composing a chant.
- Also take a look at the list of Gregorian notation symbols in the Manual on pp. 95-96.



​	**To compose your chant:**

- Choose a short (chant-length) text that you like, and break it into syllables. Some possibilities:

- - A favorite poem or song lyrics
  - The St. John’s motto: *Facio liberos ex liberis libris libraque*
  - The text of one of the chants in the Manual

- Choose a final (an anchor note) for your chant. First turn on the [Tonescape](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/tonescapes_0.mp3), then choose one of the following notes to be your final. Your chant should end on this note.

- - [Option 1](https://szynalski.com/tone#G3,v0.75) (G)
  - [Option 2](https://www.szynalski.com/tone-generator/#D3,v0.75) (D)
  - [Option 3](https://szynalski.com/tone#F3,v0.75) (F)
  - [Option 4](https://szynalski.com/tone#E3,v0.75) (E)

- Choose a reciting tone. If your final is note number 1, count up to note number 5, and this is your reciting tone. For example, the note on the syllable “e” in "Ho-di-e” is a reciting tone that repeats throughout the chant. You can use the reciting tone to contrast with your final.

- Start by singing along with the tonescape to compose your chant. Once it starts sounding good, notate what you sing.

- - Consider the range of your chant. It could be as few as 5 notes (between the final and reciting tone), or as many as 9, if you use the full range from the space below the staff to the space above it. You’ll have to place your final on a line or space so that the range of your chant will fit on the staff. 

- Have fun, and by all means, feel free to go all out decorating your manuscript!



If you’d like us to sing your chant in class, turn in your manuscript to the Switchboard by the end of the day before our class meets, so I can make copies (I’ll give the original back to you in class). And if you have any questions, observations, tips, tricks… let me know!

Mr. Forrest
