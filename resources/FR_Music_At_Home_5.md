Dear Freshman Music,

I hope you’ve been enjoying singing this week!

I’m not going to give you anything new to do before our next meeting—only to keep working toward really feeling confident with our most recent [tonescape exercise](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdavidforrest.github.io%2FFR_Music%2Fresources%2Fswitch_to_number_names.html&data=05|01|David.Forrest@sjc.edu|e876c37ab8814815dec408db1045a18a|f39b2a6e912b4008ab21cf8340cfe999|1|0|638121663652063282|Unknown|TWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D|3000|||&sdata=%2BfbFXjUTS2SnD4NLkoJR8nTFUkR0rPE96nQBJ%2BnXJFc%3D&reserved=0), and building speed [recognizing notes](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdavidforrest.github.io%2FFR_Music%2Fresources%2FSR_notes.pdf&data=05|01|David.Forrest@sjc.edu|e876c37ab8814815dec408db1045a18a|f39b2a6e912b4008ab21cf8340cfe999|1|0|638121663652063282|Unknown|TWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D|3000|||&sdata=nergHMNnLX7MBDTLF4ey06AYs9gS7WmC5lYtxq1iY1k%3D&reserved=0). I’d like for us to be able to build on both of these skills next week.

I’d also like to remind you that Mr. Carey, Mr. Kingston, and I will be participating in a tutor panel about the Music Program tomorrow (Friday) afternoon from 12:15-1:15 in the JCR. If you’d like to hear or share some thoughts about music at St. John’s, please come join us!

And now, back to the music.

Mr. Forrest
