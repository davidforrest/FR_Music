Hi Freshman Music,

Here’s what to do before our next meeting:



**1. Note Reading**

Practice building your speed at recognizing and naming notes on your [note reading sheet](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/SR_notes.pdf). We’ll continue to go around the table each class, aiming for a tempo of one note per second without missing a beat.



**2. Tonescapes**

[Here are recordings](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/three_modes.html) for each of the three modes we practiced in class.

When you press the “Choose Randomly” button, a random one of the recordings will begin playing. Name the Anchor, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, or 6th as before, but now, also listen for which of the three modes you’re in (don’t look when you press the button!)

Try to recognize the feeling of each mode at first, the impression it makes, rather than trying to figure out which notes make it up. Remember that keeping yourself oriented to the anchor will help bring out the distinctive sound of each mode. The anchor is the same for all three modes.



**3. Bach: *Befiehl du deine Wege***

Finish copying the score on p. 68 of the Manual into four separate parts. [Here’s](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/bach_befiehl_starter.pdf) an example with the Soprano part filled in to help you get started. This example also includes three notes of the Alto part that were printed incorrectly in the Manual.

Some tips for how to go about copying your score:

- Use pencil so you can erase if necessary!
- Copy only the notes. Ignore all other symbols (like sharps and flats, clefs, key signature, and so on) for now.
- Change the note stem directions to face upward if a note is below the middle line of the staff, downward if it's above the middle line, and either up or down (depending on what best matches the surrounding notes) if it’s right on the middle line.
- Start the first note on the very first dot, and make each dot equal in value to one eighth note (the note with one flag). This means that quarter notes will take up two dots, half notes will take up four dots, etc.
- There are exactly enough dots on the page to cover all the notes in the piece. So if you have any dots left over, or if you run out of dots, go back and check your note values!

We’ll use the notation you create to start singing this piece together in class next week. And it looks like we may also be able to join up with Mr. Carey’s class again during the second part of our class.

Enjoy the week, and let me know if you have any questions!

Mr. Forrest
