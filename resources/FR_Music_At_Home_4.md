Hi Freshman Music,

Here's what to do before our next class:



**1. Ave Verum Corpus**

Next week we’ll join up with Mr. Carey’s class to sing *Ave Verum Corpus* together as a larger group. To prepare, practice singing your part along with the [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduY8lh6B_Q) of the full choir. Use the score on pages 70-73 of your Manual.

Here are some helpful recordings that isolate each of the vocal parts. You can use these to get to know your own part better:

- [Soprano part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUB7j_flem0)
- [Alto part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ch9EZL3vsA)
- [Tenor part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OapQoxQbliE)
- [Bass part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8ja9_9J3oA) 



Unlike chant, *Ave Verum Corpus* has a feeling of changing anchors. If we were to imagine the piece as a collection of several short chants, one after the other, it may look something like the following. Try circling each of these finals in your score, and pay attention to each new final as you listen and sing:

- Measures 1-6, with [final “D”](https://szynalski.com/tone#D4,v0.75) in the Bass and Alto parts, on the last syllable of measure 6.
- Measures 7-10, with [final “A”](https://szynalski.com/tone#A3,v0.75) in the Bass and Tenor parts in measure 10.
- Measures 11-21, with [final “A”](https://szynalski.com/tone#A3,v0.75) in the Bass and Soprano parts in measure 18.
- Measures 22-25, with [final “F”](https://szynalski.com/tone#F3,v0.75) in the Bass and Alto parts, on the last syllable of measure 25. 
- Measures 26-29, returning to [final “A”](https://szynalski.com/tone#A3,v0.75) in the Bass part in measure 29.
- Measures 30-37, with [final “D”](https://szynalski.com/tone#D4,v0.75) in the Alto part in measure 37, but it’s hidden, and doesn’t really sound like an arrival to “D.”
- Measures 37-46, with [“D” finally](https://szynalski.com/tone#D4,v0.75) arriving in the Bass, Alto, and Soprano parts in measure 43. 



**2. Tonescapes**

- By popular demand, I made you [a recording](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/switch_to_number_names.html) that hopefully explains last week’s tonescapes exercise a little more clearly. Give this a listen, and try to practice the exercises for between 5-15 minutes every day this week. This is an important one, so I’d like to make sure we’re all able to recognize notes in different octaves before too long.
- For some variation, keep up[ last week’s recording](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/tonescapes_3.mp3), where you imagine the notes first before they’re played.



**3. Note Reading**

Finally, keep practicing your [note reading exercise](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/SR_notes.pdf) and try to increase your speed. Read through as much of the sheet as you can in 5 minutes, and turn the sheet upside down for variation. If you’re going more slowly, make sure to read through at least one line each day.



Let me know if you have any questions, and see you next week!

Mr. Forrest
