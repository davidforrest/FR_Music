## Musical Intuitions and Vocal Improv

(notes)



#### 1. Some Framing

- Significance of current music to studying the Western Canon?
- Where this playlist comes from
- Intuitions from the music around us
- Infinite domains in a music video
- Why focus on the pitch domain?



#### 2. Match notes with the song

- So let's start by trying to sing with these songs a little bit.
- Choose a song we like (or at least don't dislike too much)
  - Sometimes a mellow song is easiest to sing with at first. 
- Starting with just one note, any note, that fits with the song.
  - I'll pick the note at first. Trying to start with a note that feels most prominent in the song. See what we come up with, but aim at finding the anchor note. 
  - Hum that note and listen to it with the song.
- Then sing the next note up, and the next in order... a scale of all the notes, beginning from our first note.
  - Sometimes while doing this, we'll collectively sing a note that isn't part of the collection that fits with the song. Usually this happens with notes of the Major scale, when the song doesn't fit with the Major scale. 
  - This is a moment when an expectation based on past music experience overcomes our current listening. An opportunity to begin differentiating our ideas about music from our experience of music.
- So listen, get into the tonal world of the song, pause on individual notes and really make sure everyone can sing each note together. Listen to the sound, the feeling of each note with the song.



#### 3. Vocal Improv

- Then, within that world of notes we just sang, try singing anything you want, a little melody, anything you want. Try to add something with your voice that sounds good along with this song. I'll demo at first, and everybody will sing something different.
  - You can also start singing based on an idea, for example, to sing one note along with the beat, or to sing one note and alternate with another higher or lower note that fits with the song. Some people will start to create harmonies, or sing particular parts of the songs, or patterns...
- Then turn the song down gradually, but keep singing. And the sound of our collective singing takes over as our template for singing new things. The song gave us some structure to start, we retained some of it, and built on it.
- And we made some music together, probaby with at least a few moments that felt especially good.



#### 4. Discuss the experience a little

- Probably we had the experience, even just briefly, where it felt like we really blended together as a group. That's a pretty cool experience to have and to hold on to at the beginning. To try to find our way back to.

- A take away: You're not coming to this experience from scratch, and you're also not building it up from basics. You're starting top down, from a lot of intuitions you already have about music.
