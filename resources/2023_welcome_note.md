Dear Freshman Music,

i'm very excited to be doing this course with you. We're in a unique position this semester to experiment with ideas that could help shape the way this class works going forward. Freshman Music began as Freshman Chorus, and was an opportunity for the whole Freshman class to sing together once a week. It has since evolved into a tutorial-sized class that, in addition to singing, is an introduction to the study of music as a liberal art, and a preparation for more in-depth work next year in Sophomore Music.

In my opinion, though, it is the very beginning of music study that's the most fascinating. The simplest matters that we tend to take for granted can show themselves to be endlessly deep and mysterious, as we've no doubt discovered in our other tutorials, and in seminar, any time we attempt to inquire into the elements of things. It is also through beginner music study that we first attempt to turn a mirror to ourselves and the intuitions that arise from our own vast exposure to music throughout our lives.

Over the years, Freshman Music has built up a wealth of resources, activities, and traditions to introduce us to the study of music as a liberal art. This semester, we'll rediscover this tradition together, creatively, in the following ways:

- First, we will sing together, sometimes paired with Mr. Carey's class as a larger chorus, and sometimes in our smaller setting, as in seminar, finding our own voice and closely listening to others. 
- Second, we will explore some of the philosophy and theory of the Western musical system through originary texts and through a historical construction of the Western notation system. 
- Third, we will explore what it means to fluently read and write in this notation system.
- And finally, we will learn how to hear any note in any piece of music and have a visceral&mdash;and nameable&mdash;feeling of its unique position among other notes. This will transform your experience of analyzing music next year in Sophomore Music. 

The main instrument we will use in Freshman Music is our voice. But I'd also like to share with you that in addition to our class this semester, I will be testing out lessons for my PhD thesis, which is a beginner keyboard method that emphasizes improvisation. This will take place during the Experimental Music Practicum on Wednesday evenings at 6:30 in FAB 109, and will complement the material from our class. I would be delighted if you'd like to be involved.

And finally, [here]() is a (very primitive) website where I will begin to host resources for our class. Please bookmark this page so you'll be able to find it easily and regularly as the semester progresses.



Looking forward to learning with you,

Mr. Forrest
