**Three Note Naming Systems**
*A-B-C, 1-2-3, Do-Re-Mi, (baby you and me)*

This is only an outline at the moment, but I'll add more throughout the week, so check back!

- In Week 1, we started with our intuitions, built a musical system, and gave it **letter names**.
- Then last week and this week, we sang positions within that system, and reoriented to different anchors. 
  - Why do the different anchors create different feelings? Because there is an uneven spacing of the notes (letter positions) in our musical system (see the [monochord inlay](monochord_note_spacing.pdf) from class).
  - When we're not there to sing and say "put *this* note *here*," we can use a clef: "put a C or an F *here*." 
- And we can use **numbers** to start from any letter position.
  - the evenness of the numbers correspond to the evenness of the lines and spaces of the staff&mdash;we hear these as successive degrees, even though the spaces (ratios) between the notes of our musical system are uneven.
- But what if we wanted the sound of the C mode, but starting on F?
  - **Syllables** from the chant *Ut Queant Laxis* gave us a way represent the uneven distances in the diatonic system, but abstracted from the letters.
  - so we can make Ut (which would be the C mode), starting on F, as is done in Hodie. And then we need a new note&mdash;a "lower" version of the B.
  - Continuing in this way, we can populate a 12 note system, with "lower" and "higher" variations of the letters, changing different letters depending on which mode we want to create from which starting note.
- So, an accidental (like the &#9837;B in Hodie) can set the staff to a particular mode or anchor. 
- But these symbols can also be departures from the existing mode or anchor.
  - Moving the accidental to the beginning of the line modifies every instance of that note throughout the piece, establishing a new context (a "key signature"). Then any remaining accidentals are departures from that context.
  - The modified staff matches what we hear, since we're listening in the context of the key signature.
  - And this raises the question: is a momentary departure from context a move into a different context? (TBC in *Ave Verum Corpus*)
