Hi Freshman Music,

Next week we’ll join up with Mr. Carey’s class to sing *Ave Verum Corpus* as a larger group. Here’s what to do before then:

[1.] Turn on the [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduY8lh6B_Q) of *Ave Verum Corpus* and practice singing your part (Bass, Tenor, Alto, or Soprano) along with the recording. Use the score on pages 70-73 of your Manual. 

- Let the recording be like your tonescape, and follow the notation in the same way you did when you sang chant. As you sing, try to focus your listening to the other parts as well. This will help you blend your own part with the group.

- Unlike chant, *Ave Verum Corpus* has a feeling of changing anchors. If we were to imagine the piece as a collection of several short chants, one after the other, it may look something like the following. Try circling each of these finals in your score, and listen to the piece with an awareness of each new final:

  - Measures 1-6, with [final “D”](https://szynalski.com/tone#D4,v0.75) in the Bass and Alto parts, on the last syllable of measure 6.
  - Measures 7-10, with [final “A”](https://szynalski.com/tone#A3,v0.75) in the Bass and Tenor parts in measure 10.
  - Measures 11-21, with [final “A”](https://szynalski.com/tone#A3,v0.75) in the Bass and Soprano parts in measure 18.
  - Measures 22-25, with [final “F”](https://szynalski.com/tone#F3,v0.75) in the Bass and Alto parts, on the last syllable of measure 25. 
  - Measures 26-29, returning to [final “A”](https://szynalski.com/tone#A3,v0.75) in the Bass part in measure 29.
  - Measures 30-37, with [final “D”](https://szynalski.com/tone#D4,v0.75) in the Alto part in measure 37, but it’s hidden, and doesn’t really sound like an arrival to “D.”
  - Measures 37-46, with [“D” finally](https://szynalski.com/tone#D4,v0.75) arriving in the Bass, Alto, and Soprano parts in measure 43. 

[2.] Practice your tonescapes daily for between 5 and 15 minutes.

- [Here's a recording](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/tonescapes_4.mp3) with just the Anchor, 2nd, and 7th in different octaves. This will make it easier to begin separating the feeling of “highness” and “lowness” from the feeling of number positions relative to the anchor. It will help to hum the three notes in your comfortable vocal range, and match the note you hear—regardless of its octave—with the version of that note in your comfortable vocal range.
- When you’re ready, [here’s the recording](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/tonescapes_5.mp3) that adds the 3rd and 6th.
- For some variation, keep up[ last week’s recording](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/tonescapes_3.mp3), where you imagine the notes first before they’re played.

[3.] Finally, keep practicing your [note reading exercise](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/SR_notes.pdf) and try to increase your speed. Read through as much of the sheet as you can in 5 minutes, and turn the sheet upside down for variation. If you’re going more slowly, make sure to read through at least one line each day.

Let me know if you have any questions, and see you next week!

Mr. Forrest
