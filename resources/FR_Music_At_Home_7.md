Hi Freshman Music,

I hope you enjoyed singing Bach this week—you sounded great!

Next week we’ll be able to dig a little deeper into what’s happeing in the score. Here’s what to do before then:

**1. Score Copy**

Finish copying your score into four separate parts (if you haven’t done so already), and bring your copy with you next class so we can add to it. You can look at [last week’s email](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/FR_Music_At_Home_6.html) for tips on how to go about copying your score.

**2. Note Reading**

Keep building your speed at [reading notes](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/SR_notes.pdf). I’d recommend reading through at least one line of the sheet every day. You’ll be surprised how quickly your speed increases if you do this regularly, even just for a little bit.

**3. Tonescapes**

[Here are recordings](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/light_heavy_3rd_6th.html) that add “light” and “heavy” names to the 3rd and 6th for each of our three modes. There's also a recording that plays both kinds of 3rd and 6th together with the Dorian (neutral) mode. 

Try using the “Choose Randomly” button and get to know the qualities of the 3rd and 6th in each mode. Then, see if you can tell the different kinds of 3rds and 6ths apart when they’re all played together in the same mode. A tip: the light third and heavy sixth will sound like they don’t fit with the Dorian tonescape, and this will help you tell them apart at first.

Let me know if you have any questions, and enjoy your week!

Mr. Forrest
