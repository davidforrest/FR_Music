Hi Freshman Music,

Here’s what to do before we meet next:

[1.] Listen to your tonescapes daily for between 5 and 15 minutes. 

- Start with [this week’s recording](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/tonescapes_4.mp3), where the names have changed from “one higher, two higher, one lower, two lower” to “second, third, seventh, and sixth.” Since we also now have notes in different octaves, it may help at first to bring a note into your comfortable vocal range by humming it, then hum the notes leading back to the anchor to hear the distance and direction. 
- Then go on to [last week’s recording](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/tonescapes_3.mp3), where you imagine the notes first before they’re played.
- As an extra, you can listen to the [tonescape by itself](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/tonescapes_0.mp3), let your mind wander, and pay attention to what you hear. Can you make yourself hear any notes or melodies inside the tonescape?

[2.] Practice your [note reading exercise](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/SR_notes.pdf) daily for about 5 minutes. 

- Start with just the first line. Read the notes from bottom to top (each pair is connected by a vertical line), saying the letter names aloud. Take as much time as you need.
- Use the clefs as a guide to find the letter names. The clef on the lower staff places “F” on the second line from the top, so the first note is an “A.” The clef on the upper staff places “G” on the second line from the bottom, so the first note is an "F.”
- You can come up with tricks to read the notes more quickly. For example, if a new note is close to a previous note that you already know, you can use the note you know as a reference, rather than using the clef. Gradually you will get to know the unique position of each note on its own. Try to build your speed, and work through as much of the page as you can. Then turn the page upside-down for some variation.

- Note: in principle, we can place these clefs anywhere on the staff to set the position of “F” and “G.” But this particular placement has become the standard in modern music notation. So it's very helpful to be able to recognize these positions of the notes quickly, even though they are moveable.

[3.] Read:

- [A brief summary](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/in_class_wk3.html) of the note naming systems we covered in class. Hopefully this will help to organize the ideas for you, and we will also come back to them in future classes.
- [Guido of Arezzo: *Prologus antiphonarii sui* (excerpt)](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/guido_staff_clefs.pdf). Guido describes his invention of the musical staff and clefs.
- [Guido of Arezzo: Epistola de ingoto cantu (excerpt)](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/guido_syllables.pdf). Guido goes on to describe the syllable system he derived from *Ut Queant Laxis*.

[4.] Finally, listen to [Mozart’s *Ave Verum Corpus*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduY8lh6B_Q) and try to follow along with the musical score beginning on p. 70 of the Manual. 

- Even if you don’t yet know what all of the modern notation symbols mean, see if you can follow the contours of the melody based on what you learned about the staff system from writing and singing chant. The four staves are four different vocal parts singing together at the same time—try to follow one individual vocal part, and to hear it in the recording, then listen again for each of the other parts, and for all of the parts together. We’ll read and sing *Ave Verum Corpus* together in more detail in our next class.

See you next week!

Mr. Forrest
